Description: Python App to run Livox Lidar
        
        SnowyOwl is divided in 2 parts, the acquisition routines that rely on vey little dependencies appart from the OpenPyLIVOX SDK, and the processing routines mostly using PDAL. The aquisition is done on a Raspberry Pi, which then transfers the binary outputs from the LIVOX to a secondary machine running Linux Mint that handles the processing.
        
        The processing is in 3 parts :
        * Convert bin to LAS files using the OpenPyLIVOX
        * Apply a 6 parameter transformation (rotation and translations) to georeference the output, or at the very least set the vertical upwards
        * Export a DEM from the data and crop a region of interest where the whole cloud is to be saved.
        
        The Rasberry and the processing laptops have enough drive space to hold all of the data in their final state (for the device). The Pi uses scp to transfer the bin to the laptop, then moves the sent files to an archive folder. The laptop uses rsync with a server space to keep the OUTPUT of the processing chain in sync.
